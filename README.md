# Sudoku
This Python project implements a 4x4 Sudoku-like board game that enforces three classic rule constraints: horizontal, vertical, and square uniqueness. The user is prompted to fill in the board one cell at a time, and the game checks for rule violations after each input until the board is successfully completed.
